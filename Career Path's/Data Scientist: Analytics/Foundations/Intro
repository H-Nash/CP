## Why Data Science?

### SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of many methods to access a database.
A database is a set of data stored in a computer. It is usually structured in tables and they can grow larger with multiple columns and records.
We use a set of instructions called queries to access data.

### Python
Python is a general-purpose programming language. It can do almost all of what other languages can do with comparable, or faster, speed.
It is one of the most userfriendly languages to use due to its large collection of libraries.
One such library is pandas which is a special set of cammands that helps with data analytics.
When visualizing data we can use libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
This lets you create different graphs and charts with percise control over the visuals.
